# This directory contains migration scripts for Karei version upgrades
# Migrations are named with Unix timestamps and run chronologically
# Example: 1718359027.sh (timestamp when migration was created)
#
# Migration scripts handle:
# - Configuration file format changes
# - New application installations  
# - System integration updates
# - Breaking changes between versions
#
# The migrate.sh script automatically runs migrations newer than the last git update
